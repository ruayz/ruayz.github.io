I'm Zhi Yang, a third-year master's student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), advised by [Dr. Changwu Huang](https://changwuhuang.github.io/), [Prof. Ke Tang](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/tangke.html) and [Prof. Xin Yao](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UUtYPl4AAAAJ&hl=en) (Lingnan University).

My research centers on trustworthy machine learning, with a focus on explainability, privacy, and fairness. I am also highly interested in trustworthy large language models (LLMs) and their interdisciplinary applications across diverse domains.

I am a PhD applicant expecting to graduate in Summer 2026 and am actively seeking PhD opportunities. You can download my CV [here](http://ruayz.github.io/files/CV.pdf) and contact me directly via email at [zhiyangzzz1@gmail.com](mailto:zhiyangzzz1@gmail.com).

Research Experience
------
- *Adaptive Personalized LLM for Multi-Turn Conversations*: Aims to develop a  personalized LLM capable of dynamically adapting its responses to a user's demographic characteristics, background knowledge, communication style, and personality across multi-turn dialogues.
- *Multi-Agent Systems with LLMs*:
    - Investigated the impact of emotional prompts on agent behaviors in a multi-agent LLMs system across diverse network topologies, concluding that modern LLMs are robust to such stimuli, with no consistent topology-dependent variance.
    - Explored distilling multi-agent collaboration into a single LLM.
- *Fair Privacy*: Developed a novel membership inference game to efficiently approximate worst-case privacy risks, enabling stricter and more reliable assessment of group privacy disparities. Introduced a group-specific adaptive gradient clipping strategy for DP-SGD to effectively reduce disparities in group privacy risks.
- *Fairness & Privacy*: Proposed a group-specific DP-SGD training framework combined with classification threshold optimization to jointly mitigate accuracy disparities and achieve outcome fairness in differentially private models.
- *Explainability & Fairness*: Designed an explainable feature selection (ExFS) method that improves model fairness by recursively removing features contributing to unfairness, guided by feature attribution explanations (FAE) of model predictions.
